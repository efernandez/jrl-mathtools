   \section intro_jrlMathTools Introduction

   This package implements basic mathematical tools. The main classes are
   \li jrlMathTools::Cangle for simple angle computations,
   \li jrlMathTools::Matrix4x4 for 4x4 matrices,
       mainly for homogeneous matrices,
   \li jrlMathTools::Matrix3x3 for 3x3 matrices, mainly for rotation matrices,
   \li jrlMathTools::Vector4D for 4 dimensional vectors,
   \li jrlMathTools::Vector3D for 3 dimensional vectors.
